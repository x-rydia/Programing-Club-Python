#This is a comment in python, python ignores everything I type here
#Hey python, you suck ass. See? It didn't read, otherwise it would be offended.

#NECESSARY VOCAB
#string - anything between two sets of "" or ''
#integer - counting number
#float - mixed decimal numbers
#Boolean - true or false
#nonetypes - none, just nothing

#One of the fundamental objects in python is the variable. We define a variable
#like so:

x = "MyBigBrainVariable"
#X has a string value

#notice that there is an identifier on the left side of the assignment operator (=)
#we can call the variable by it's identifier like so

print(x)

#If you pass the identifier through the print function it appears on the screen.

#the variables are reasignable, meaning I can change x to equal anything else
x = 1.974580
x = 76
x = "string"
x = false

#You can change the data type of a variable like so
x = float(x)
x = str(x)
x = int(x)
